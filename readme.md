# Xemo is a true object oriented storage library

If you agree to these statements, Xemo may be for you:

- All data should be encapsulated
- Objects are for processing data, not for holding data
- Object oriented programming is about messages between objects
- Clean architecture requires state management seperated from entity behaviour

# Under Change
First design concept of the library has been revoked, new readme wil follow.
